The only file I can change is the "ProductInventory.cpp"  

I made a call to the function in the driver, not suppose to output anything.  
Just wanted to see if it works, and I am getting Segmentation fault: 11.

If you search either file for MATT, you will find a note I made for you.

Thank you for the help!!
